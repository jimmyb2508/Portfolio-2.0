I utilise an Object Oriented Approach to Programming. I write robust code with Test Driven Development. This means I am able to create structured, layered and designed websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

I can run a webserver and create APIs with Node.js and Express. I have knowledge of NOSQL databases such as MongoDB which I use to store data. I have deployed many projects to Github and have included some links below for you to enjoy my work!
